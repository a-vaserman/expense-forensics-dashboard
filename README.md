# Expense Forensics Dashboard

## Project Overview

Utilizing the power of artificial intelligence, I created a mock dataset that contains expense-related information as well as developed a set of company policies to conduct an extensive expense audit. Working on this has helped deveop my Excel skills, and forensic analysis methodologies. This project is meant to simulate similar tasks to what a consultant might encounter, especially in investigations, a pratice area with a considerable amount of  revenue for many consulting firms.
