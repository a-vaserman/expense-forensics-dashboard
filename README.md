# Expense Forensics Dashboard

## Project Overview

Utilizing the power of artificial intelligence, I created a mock dataset that contains expense-related information as well as developed a set of company policies to conduct an extensive expense audit. Working on this has helped deveop my Excel skills and understanding of forensic analysis methodologies. This project is meant to simulate similar tasks to what a consultant might encounter, especially in investigations, a pratice area with a considerable amount of  revenue for many consulting firms.

## Dataset Overview

The simulated dataset contains 500 individual records. Each record represents a company expense that an employee filed, characterized by key variables like the date of the transasction, the employee who filed the expense, their department, the category under which the expense falls, the expense amount, and more. To guide the audit, I developed a set of company policies that reflect typical corporate expense guidelines. These rules served as the foundation for identifying potentially non-compliant, anomalous, or high-risk expense entries during my analysis. Each policy introduced a layer of analytical criteria that shaped how I manipulated the dataset.
